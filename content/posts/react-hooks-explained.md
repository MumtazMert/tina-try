# React Hooks Explained - A Beginner's Guide

React Hooks have revolutionized how we write React components. They allow us to use state and other React features in functional components, making our code cleaner and more maintainable.

## What are Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have become the standard way to write React components.

## The Most Common Hooks

### 1. useState

The `useState` hook is the most basic hook. It lets you add state to functional components.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. useEffect

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in functional components. It's similar to `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` combined.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This runs after every render
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs only once

  return <div>{data ? data.title : 'Loading...'}</div>;
}
```

### 3. useContext

The `useContext` hook lets you consume React context without nesting.

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button className={theme}>I am styled by theme context!</button>;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Only call hooks at the top level** - Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
2. **Only call hooks from React functions** - Call hooks from React function components or custom hooks
3. **Use the dependency array correctly** - Always include all values from the component scope that change over time

## Custom Hooks

You can create your own hooks to extract component logic into reusable functions.

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useWindowSize() {
  const [windowSize, setWindowSize] = useState({
    width: undefined,
    height: undefined,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleResize() {
      setWindowSize({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
      });
    }

    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    handleResize();

    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);

  return windowSize;
}
```

## Conclusion

Hooks have made React more accessible and easier to understand. They promote better code organization and reusability. Start with `useState` and `useEffect`, then gradually explore other hooks as you become more comfortable.

Remember, practice makes perfect! Try building small components using hooks to get familiar with them.
